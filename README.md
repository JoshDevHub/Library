# Library

Small library app created with vanilla JavaScript

## Description

This is a small CRUD app to practice using prototypes in JavaScript. I also used the opportunity to practice some styling techniques (creating a toggle button, responsiveness with minimal media queries).

The deployment of the app can be seen here on [GitHub pages](https://joshdevhub.github.io/Library/).
